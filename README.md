Vahana VR & VideoStitch Studio: software to create immersive 360° VR video, live and in post-production.

The software was originally developed by VideoStitch SAS. After the company folded in early 2018, the source code was acquired by the newly founded non-profit organization stitchEm, to publish it under a free software license.

### Vahana VR
Vahana VR is a camera-rig independent real-time 360° VR video stitching software.

With Vahana VR you can capture multiple video streams, stitch them instantly into a single 360°×180° video file, preview the result in real-time and stream it to any 360° video player or compatible platform.

Vahana VR supports range of video capture and output hardware, including Decklink SDI cards from BlackMagic Design, and HDMI capture cards from Magewell, Ximea cameras and RTMP network broadcasting.

VideoStitch Studio supports input synchronization, automatic calibration, exposure and color correction, video stabilisation and a range of different output formats.
